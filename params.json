  "body": "## HPGLGraphics Library for Processing\r\n\r\nThis library implements [HPGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPGL) (Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language) file creation from Processing sketches. It works in much the same way as the PDF Export and DXF Export libraries bundled with Processing.\r\n\r\n### Getting started \r\n\r\n    import hpglgraphics.*;\r\n    HPGLGraphics hpgl = (HPGLGraphics) createGraphics(width, height, HPGLGraphics.HPGL);\r\n    setPath(\"filename.hpgl\");\r\n    beginRecord(hpgl);\r\n    // do some drawing\r\n    endRecord();\r\n\r\nHave a look at the examples included with the library. These demonstrate:\r\n\r\n  * line()\r\n  * ellipse() (and circles)\r\n  * arc(0 (PIE, CHORD and OPEN)\r\n  * rect()\r\n\r\n### Additional methods\r\n\r\nSome additional methods are available for controlling the HPGL output. This include:\r\n  * selectPen(int pen);       // choose another pen (e.g. colour)\r\n  * setPaperSize();           // \"A3\" or \"A4\". Landscape orientation is assumed.\r\n  * setPath(\"filename.hpgl\"); // required. HPGL is output to this file in the sketch directory.\r\n\r\nThis library was inspired by, and builds upon, these libraries:\r\n  * [HPGL-Plotter](http://sjunnesson.github.io/HPGL-Plotter/)\r\n  * [HPGL](https://github.com/gregersn/HPGL)\r\n\r\nThe website for the library is [here](https://ciaron.github.io/HPGLGraphics).\r\nSource code is [here](https://github.com/ciaron/HPGLGraphics)\r\n",
